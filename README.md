A minimal implemenation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) in PyTorch, going for clarity over optimality for educational purposes. The model comes trained on thumbnails of characters from a beloved video game series. We make use of milesial's free UNet model defintion for a denoising model: https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet.
